# Symbolic GKAT Equivalence 
This repository implements Zhang's symbolic
[GKAT](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3371129) equivalence algorithm.

## Building
Requires the `cargo` build tool for the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
programming language.

To build the equivalence checker:
``` sh
cargo build --release
```
The resulting executable can be found at `target/release/rust-gkat`.

## Usage
`rust-gkat` offers 2 solver kernels for checking equivalence of boolean expressions.
Modes and kernels can be combined freely.

- kernel `k1`: symbolic derivative method (default)
``` sh
rust-gkat -k k1 ./input/test00.txt
```
- kernel `k2`: symbolic thompson's construction
``` sh
rust-gkat -k k2 ./input/test00.txt
```

## Input Format
Each input file consists of 3 s-expressions. The first 2 s-expressions are the
GKAT expressions for equivalence testing. The final `(equiv ...)` marks whether
these 2 expressions are expected to be equivalent or not.

Sample from `input/test10.txt`:
```
(seq
  (seq
    (seq
      (seq (seq p7 p10) p9) (if b66 (if (or b79 b78 b68) p8 p1) (seq p6 p1)))
    (seq (if (not b25) p5 p22) p3 p0 p7) (seq p6 p2)
    (if (and b60 b18 b99) (seq p3 p98) p6))
  (seq (seq p9 p8) p2) (seq p25 p5)
  (if (and (or b82 b42) (or b42 b82)) (if (and b52 b75) p6 p1) p20))

(seq
  (seq
    (seq
      (seq (seq p7 p10) p9)
      (if b66 (if (or (or b79 b78) b68) p8 p1) (seq p6 p1)))
    (seq (seq (if (not b25) p5 p22) (seq p3 p0) p7) p6 p2)
    (if (and (and b60 b18) b99) (seq p3 p98) p6))
  (seq (seq p9 p8) p2) (seq p25 p5)
  (if (and (and b52 b75) (or b82 b42)) p6
    (if (and (or b82 b42) (or b42 b82)) p1 p20)))

(equiv 1)
```

For n-ary syntax such `(seq A B C)`, it is parsed right-associatively into
binary form as `(seq A (seq B C))`.

## Performance and Evaluation
Currently, we have tested `rust-gkat` on all large GKAT pairs contained in
`dataset.zip`. One can also use `make k1` or `make k2` to run `rust-gkat` on
all examples in the dataset.

### Symbolic Derivative Method
Even for difficult examples such as `exp9000.txt`, we achieve a very competitive
runtime of `0.04s` and peak memory consumption of `15MB` with the symbolic derivative 
method.

```

### Symbolic Thompson's Construction
The algorithm for symbolic thompson's construction performs much better than
the derivative method due to algorithmic improvements. Examples provided in `dataset.zip`
are no longer useful as runtime benchmarks as each test solves in `0.00s`.
```
➞  /usr/bin/time -l ./target/release/rust-gkat -k k2 dataset/exp9000.txt
equiv_expected = true
equiv_result   = true
        0.00 real         0.00 user         0.00 sys

```

We provide a dataset `dataset_big.zip` containing even larger examples with expression size
of 1,000,000. These examples are far more challenging to solve. Kernel1 (derivative method) 
will not be able to solve some of these problems in a timely manner. Use `make big` to run 
`rust-gkat` on all big examples.
